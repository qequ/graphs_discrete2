<p>A set of algorithms for greedy coloring graphs.</p>
<p>It uses as input the DIMACS format and we have implemented our own graph & vertice data structures</p>

## Main Algorithms

### Greedy coloring graph

<p>Classic implementation of the algorithm for coloring a graph with the 
greedy heuristic</p>

### Bipartite checking algorithm

<p>Algorithm for checking if the given graph is bipartite. If not, color it with the greedy algorithm</p>

### Different orders for vertices

<p>Useful functions for order vertices accord to different principles;</p>

<ol>
    <li>ordering vertices given their names in natural order</li>
    <li>Welsh-Powell order, i.e. ordering vertices in decreasing order of grade</li>
    <li>RMBC</li>
    <li>Others</li>

</ol>
